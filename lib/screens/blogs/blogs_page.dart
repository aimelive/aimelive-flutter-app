Jack Worthing is Cecily Cardew's guardian, which is pretty boring. So, he pretends to have a rowdy younger brother, Ernest, who's always getting into trouble. Every once in a while, Jack's got to rush to London to clean up one of Ernest's messesâ€¦and have a little fun himself.in this scene, his friend Algernon finally finds out about the little scam that Jack has been running and decides he might try something like it to woo Jack's ward Cecily. Hilarity and a whole lot of misunderstandings ensue from there, but Algernon's words turn out to be trueâ€”the truth turns out to be a whole lot more complicated than you'd actually imagine it to be.",
